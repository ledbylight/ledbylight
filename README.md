👋 Hi there! I'm a wee lil' Computer Science student in the US, trying to improve my coding skills day by day! 💻

🚀 My goal? To move to Germany after I graduate in Fall 2027! 🇩🇪 I'm working hard to make that dream a reality.

Here's a little about me:

* 🎓 Studying Computer Science in the USA; my degree has an emphasis in Big Data Analytics, but I'm slowly falling in love with coding💙
* 🗣️ Fluent in English and working towards fluency in German (Currently at a B2 level! 🎉).
* 🌐 Excited about exploring new technologies and contributing to open-source projects.
* 🌱 Always learning and eager to collaborate.

Feel free to check out my repositories! I'm always open to connecting with fellow developers as well as language learners. 🤝

Let's build something awesome together! ✨
